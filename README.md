# Important Information regarding the new Steam UI-Update
Sadly, as of writing this, there is no official way of using skins on the new Steam UI right now.
There are however some kind of CSS hacks via a third-party tool the community made (since the new steam client shares a framework for Desktop-Client, Web-Client and the SteamDeck itself).
These hacks are limited in their functionality and wouldn't work at all for most skins out there (e.g. you can't edit/move bottom and top bars)

If Valve decides to bring back functionality for skins it might be in form of CSS rather than the old VGUI-stuff.
Until then this project is dead.
